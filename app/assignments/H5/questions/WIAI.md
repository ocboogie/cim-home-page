Identifiers are names. Identifiers are used to name variables, keywords, functions and labels. Identifiers may consist of letters, digits(not as the first character), underscores, or dollar signs. All of the following are identifiera:

```js
function variableIdentifier() {} // "function" is an identifier as well
var variableIdentifier = null; // "var" is also an identifier
labelIdentifier: {}
```
