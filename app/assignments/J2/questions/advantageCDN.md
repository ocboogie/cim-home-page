In most cases it's better to use a CDN for the following reasons:

1. Some browsers might cache common CDNs to increase performance.
2. It can reduces the amount of bandwidth used by your server.
3. Some CDNs will compressed their code with something like GZIP or DEFLATE. This makes the time-to-download very small.
4. They can also keep your scripts up to date.
