The easiest way to do this is in the console. You can open the console by doing ctrl+shift+i > console or right-click on the page > inspect element > console.

You can type: `arrayName[0]`. Doing so should display the first element of `arrayName`. Typing `arrayName[1]` should display the second element.

Note that the array you want to check the element of must be initialized already, in a script or in the console itself.
