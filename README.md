# cim-home-page
This is a static web page with routing I made for a college class.

You can see the website in action here http://cim.saddleback.edu/~emikulec0.

And the commit names are awful. If you're looking for a good representation of my commit names, look at [action-hub](https://github.com/ocboogie/action-hub)
